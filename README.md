# Welcome!

Build AI is a low cost GPU cloud purpose build for pre-training and fine tuning AI models. By specializing our infrastructure for asynchronous workloads and powering our hardware with cheap, renewable energy, weâ€™re able to offer **the lowest cost of compute on the market**. Companies can reserve GPUs for week-long allocations.

We offer Nvidia A100 and H100 GPUs optimized for distributed training, either available with high uptime or with predictable interruptions which pause from 5:00pm CST to 8:00pm CST daily.

[Request access to our private beta here.](https://hrvsen390v8.typeform.com/to/NsMlxksc?utm\_source=docs)
