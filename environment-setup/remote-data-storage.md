# Remote Data Storage

### Remote Data Storage

Training workloads often rely on large data sets that can be cumbersome and expensive to move. Build AI offers a secure remote data storage solution to store all of your data and take advantage of our low cost training GPU cluster. Move your data once to Build AIâ€™s secure storage for cheap and simplified access to your data during training.

On joining our private beta, your company was assigned a unique storage bucket and credentials. Our secure bucket storage uses the same API as Amazon S3. [Access the API docs here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/AmazonS3/latest/API/s3-api.pdf).

Once you have the [aws cli installed](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), you can upload all files in a local directory to the bucket using the following command.

```bash
aws s3 sync /path/to/local/directory s3://your-bucket-name --endpoint-url <https://storage.trybuild.ai>
```

Note that our storage solution uses the AWS S3 API, but is not hosted or reliant on AWS in any way.
