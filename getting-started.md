# Getting Started

To get started using GPUs from Build AI, you'll need to [fill out this form](https://hrvsen390v8.typeform.com/to/NsMlxksc?utm\_source=docs) and speak with a member of our team. We need some basic info, we'll set up a call, and we'll personally onboard your team with a dedicated member of our engineering team.&#x20;

The form will ask the following information

* Contact info (so we can set up a call)
* GPU hardware (A100 40GB, A100 80GB, H100 80GB)
* Number of GPUs you'd like to reserve (1-16)
* Ideal start date
* Estimate of length of rental (a week, weeks, months)

[Here's a link to that form again.](https://hrvsen390v8.typeform.com/to/NsMlxksc?utm\_source=docs) After filling this out, you'll hear from our team within 24 hours.
