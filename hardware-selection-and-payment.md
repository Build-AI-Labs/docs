Notes on chip types:&#x20;

1. No payment required for data movement (ingress/egress)
2. Prices listed in the chart above are “Plus applicable sales tax”
3. GPUs come pre-installed with popular ML frameworks: Ubuntu, TensorFlow, PyTorch, NVIDIA CUDA, and NVIDIA cuDNN
4. \*H100 GPUs must be reserved / used in quantities of 8 (entire server)

***



After selecting a chip type, you'll need to select a number of GPUs and length of time in weeks (ex. 4 A100 40GB GPUs for 3 weeks). From there, we'll be able to calculate your total all in price.

With your all in price set, we'll send you a payment link to prepay for your GPUs. After receiving your payment we'll begin onboarding you to the platform. Your reserve will period begin on the start date agreed upon with our team.&#x20;
