# Onboarding

Once payment has been accepted, we require that you set up an organization on our platform in order to provision access to your instances. Team members can connect to the instances housed in your organization by inviting them to join via email.&#x20;

1. Log in to our web app [https://web.buildailabs.com](https://web.buildailabs.com/dashboard) -- you can use either social login, or create an account manually [here](https://web.buildailabs.com/signup)
2. By default an organization is created that is unique to your user. You start as its sole member. You can rename that organization if you like on the [Organization Management](https://web.buildailabs.com/dashboard/organization) page. Alternatively, you can choose to keep your personal organization and create a new organization instead to invite your team to.
3.  To invite members, use the ellipses (â‹®) and select "Manage Members"

4.  From here you can invite team members to your organization:

Every user should add an SSH public key to their account. To do this, use the "Add Key" option on the [SSH Keys page](https://web.buildailabs.com/dashboard/ssh).&#x20;

If you're not familiar with SSH keys, Github provides a great tutorial on [checking for existing ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys) and [generating new keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent). An SSH key is required for each user who wants to access a BuildAI compute instance.

***

With these credentials, we'll provision your instance and provide access to your GPUs at the start of your rental period. Now it's time to train!

_(Note: If we receive your payment and we have extra GPU capacity, we may be able to provide you access to your machines before the beginning of your reserved period)_
