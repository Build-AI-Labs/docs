# Onboarding

On acceptance of your payment, our team will reach out for information on which users will be interacting with your instances. For each user we'll need to collect their:

* Name
* Email
* ssh public key

If you're not familiar with ssh keys, Github provides a great tutorial on [checking for existing ssh keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys) and [generating new keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

***

With these credentials, we'll provision your instance and provide access to your GPUs at the start of your rental period. Now it's time to train!

_(Note: If we receive your payment and we have extra GPU capacity, we may be able to provide you access to your machines before the beginning of your reserved period)_
